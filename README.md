JSON Data Reading and Web Crawling

This project demonstrates how to read data from a JSON file and perform web crawling using the extracted data.

Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
requests library (install using pip install requests)
BeautifulSoup library (install using pip install beautifulsoup4)
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Update the JSON file: Open the data.json file and replace the sample data with your own data. Each item in the JSON array should contain a 'url' attribute with the URL of the webpage you want to crawl.

Execute the code: Run the following command to execute the Python script:

shell
Copy code
python web_crawler.py
The script will read the data from the data.json file, perform web crawling on the specified URLs, and print the titles of the webpages to the console.

Note: Make sure to replace web_crawler.py with the actual filename if you renamed the file.

Customize the code: Inside the web_crawl function in web_crawler.py, you can modify the code to extract and process the desired information from the HTML content as per your requirements. Feel free to extend or modify the functionality to suit your needs.

Example Output
Upon running the code, you should see the titles of the webpages printed to the console, based on the URLs specified in the data.json file.

python
Copy code
Webpage 1 Title
Webpage 2 Title
Webpage 3 Title
...
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors related to missing libraries, make sure you have installed the required dependencies mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

If the code doesn't produce the expected output or encounters any other issues, ensure that the JSON file contains valid data and that the URLs specified in the file are accessible.
